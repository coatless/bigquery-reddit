Froejoe,"I was extremely overwhelmed by the amount of classes when I first started trying to plan my schedules. It seems like there are so many options and you don’t want to miss out on classes. 

My biggest tip is you ask your advisor! They do this a million times, they know what you need to take and what works best. Tell them your goals, when you want to graduate, and any ideas you have for minors/specific classes you want for sure. I usual find around 10 classes I want and then start looking at the times they are offered to build my days out. Your freshman year tends to be pretty standard, don’t freak out.

P.S. if you can avoid it, for the love of god avoid 8 am classes. I don’t know why but we lose all ability to wake up that early when we graduate high school."
astro_glide,"You next semesters schedule is pretty average difficultly wise. Take Accy 201 out and take something easy, its not a difficult course but I feel like Curtis would demolish you. To be honest your schedule for this semester should have been a walk in the park.

If you can't force yourself to attend class 15 hours a week you should strongly reconsider college. Going to class 3 hours a day 5 days a week is nothing. Sure, there are some people that are successful and do not show up to classes (if there is no attendance points/grade), but you are clearly not one of them.

That being said, every semester you don't pass 15 credit hours means you are falling behind on the 4 year plan. I.E. if you only take 12 you need to take 15+3=18 another semester or make it up with A.P. credits or summer/winter session classes. 

You should try to retake one of those classes over winter break, I think Econ 102/103 is being offered online. You can register until Monday, this is probably the smartest thing you can do right now, ask your advisor."

oohweecando,"MAS student here. GPA was well over 3.0 and ACCY GPA was (slightly) below 3.0 when applying. You're more or less in the same situation I was so I'll try to answer some of your questions.

1. Be worried, but not too worried is the best I can say. Never take anything for granted, but if you have ample leadership experience and prior internship experience then you should be fine. Chances are they'll caution you since your ACCY GPA is low (it's not a formal probation). Also, make sure your essays are top-notch. I can't stress that enough.

2. It's competitive. I can't give you numbers off the top of my head. though. I think there's ~120 students in the program this year.

3. I personally don't know anyone so I can't give you an accurate breakdown here.

I believe the way it works is that the university will tell anyone that you've given permission to see your records assuming they ask for that information. I'm hazy on exactly how this works though. I know of zero employers who would ask such a thing, so that's not a huge concern. 

But typically the result is that grad schools have very little interest in you. I've heard of some people still getting in but they take time in their personal statement to apologize and reconcile with their behavior. 

If you want to go to graduate school, you need to start doing things immediately to save your application.

sleepy_undergrad,"Hey, I'm a senior in LAS that completed the CS minor last semester. 

I can't speak on whether or not the CS125 credit would count as CS101 for the ME/engineering requirement (pretty easy answer if you ask your advisor), but if you don't already have a gig lined up for this summer (or you just have a flexible schedule), taking CS125 at a community college wouldn't be a bad idea. I would just try to be cognizant of what topics would be covered in the CC class versus UIUC's. 

In general though, the minor can be kind of a pain to get as the three core classes you have to take (CS125/173/225) usually fill up with CS majors who get priority. It's not *impossible* to get into, but it does usually require some patience and checking to see if a seat opens up. The same thing applies to the 3 additional courses you have to take for the minor, but can definitely vary in how hard it is to get into. It seems to get progressively harder to get into classes too since I've taken them. 

I think it's a pretty worthwhile minor to get as far as minors are concerned, but definitely consider what your actual goals are. Do you want to do more computational-based work as a MechE? For me, there was a pretty clear cross between my major and CS. I also felt my major was pretty light on workload, which I can't say the same for my engineering friends. "

_GungaGalunga_,"Sounds like a very stressful situation and one that I found myself in as well during my home stretch (not necessarily the workload, but the questioning of my future). 

I'd say the best thing to do at this point is focus on the positives. Although you're working your ass off and feeling like the weight of the world is on your back, try to take a step back from everything and look at how far you've come and take note of things you are fortunate to have- a gf who's willing to listen, an advisor who wants to bring out the absolute best in you, the opportunity to succeed in one of the best universities in the world etc. Take some time and literally write down specific things you're grateful for to help you remember that not everything is going against you.

Also share your feelings with those people. Be vulnerable and sincere so that the people around you can have a better understanding of what you're dealing with. This was hard for me but created an almost instant feeling of relief. Tell your girlfriend how much she means to you and how you're sorry if the pressure on you is rubbing off on her. Ask your advisor to meet- not to discuss your coursework, but to talk and share your current mindset. Communication is key and you should't have all of these feelings locked up to yourself where they will only continue to tear you apart from the inside out. 

You've come to far to give up and I hope that if this was once your passion, you decide to stick it out. If needed/possible I wouldn't hesitate to spread the work out over another semester. Nothing is worth sacrificing your own sanity just for the sake of moving at ""the right pace"". If not, stay after it and keep a constant reminder of what you're working for (could be your future wife, kids, dream job, or whatever you want to have in 5,10,15 years from now). Having that motivation will help you keep going.

I wrote this in a hurry as I'm about to go to bed but I know what your feeling and hope this at least helps a little. Best of luck to you and based on your post alone it seems that if nothing more, you're a good guy who truly cares which already puts you above most. "

* During your sit-in ask some students about the workload. 

* Email the professor and try to give them an accurate estimate for your availability and ask if they think you can manage it.

jandersonbliss,"""Ask your advisor"" is a meme on this sub for a reason. You really should go ask your advisor.  


As one myself, I'd ask you how you're feeling about the actual content of the course, rather than the grade you're getting. Do you feel confident in the material covered? Would you be able to rely on this knowledge moving forward with other courses that use calculus? Would you benefit from retaking the course in order to have a better grasp on the material, or are you solely concerned about your grade?  


In terms of your GPA, how are the rest of your courses going? If you're getting all As and Bs, one C+ won't wreck your overall GPA. If, instead, you're pouring all your energy into the class at the expense of the other courses you're taking and your entire performance in this semester is suffering because of it, then yeah, dropping might be an ok option. But honestly, the answers to these questions and more would determine how I'd advise you to proceed-- and that's why I suggest going to your advisor's office and asking them, so they can have this conversation with you and help you determine the best course of action."

sriracha13,"Although you probably should ask your advisor or dean for the most accurate information since it might vary, for me as a CS student, a D- is a satisfactory passing grade for the non-important required classes in my major such as Chemistry and Physics.

nonotion,"That sounds like a pretty rough schedule man. I take it you're in CEE?

I'm also a junior transfer student from a CC and I had a bit of a rough transition in the spring here, which was made a little worse by the fact that I was keeping up an apartment/cooking on my own for the first time. 

My advice to you other than what had already been said about office hours and asking professors a shitload of questions is to find a group of people in your major who you can hang out with and ask questions. 

That's easier said than done, but it can really help with staying sane and studying effectively. I'd suggest joining a club tangentially related to your major that you're interested in and asking around for people who are taking/have taken the classes you're struggling with. Also, don't hesitate to go and ask your advisor if they're aware of any resources or places you could go for help. The effectiveness of that can vary dramatically depending on your advisor, but it's always worth a shot.

As far as studying effectively goes, make sure you actively (as in work out examples/proofs yourself) read the sections covered before your lecture. That information is usually in the syllabus of your classes. You should still take thorough notes (within reason), but it will help you know what questions to ask ahead of time and what your instructors are looking for in homework/quizzes/tests."
HarmlessPotholer,"If your advisor also made the mistake, ask your advisor if they’re willing to speak to admissions on your behalf. "
fattymcbaddy,"online classes at edx or coursera will probably be recognized as a step in the right direction towards your reinstatement, but i don't think they qualify as actual credits so they won't be recognized in a transcript. I may be wrong \- ask your advisor? haha

i've been in your shoes and was reinstated after 1 semester at parkland. it was premature and i didn't actually fix my issues and was dropped again. perhaps 1 year is too expensive for you but 1 semester is do\-able, i don't know your situation. when i was dropped the second time, i was told it would be useless to apply again any sooner than 5 years later \(that was in 2012, i applied in 2017 to the masters program and got in lol\)

since you've already spoken to your advisor, i think it's past the point of appealing and you'll have to think of remedial actions. parkland is a common choice and one that has worked for me and others. i know that as an out of state student, it cost me quite a bit initially but i was actually working full time on campus. this, alongside an instate drivers license and lease and such, got me in\-state tuition at parkland. i am a citizen so maybe this doesn't apply to you. i then continued getting in state tuition at uiuc once reinstated

after getting dropped the SECOND time, what ended up working for me was taking courses online as a non\-degree student. i got As in them, held down a full time job, and by the time 2017 rolled around I had 3 As and 2 years of job experience before applying to my masters here. it's a pretty surefire way to prove you can actually handle the coursework, by actually taking the coursework as a nondegree on your own dime. [http://online.illinois.edu/](http://online.illinois.edu/), take a look at what's available for nondegree students. 

[https://admissions.illinois.edu/Apply/nondegree](https://admissions.illinois.edu/Apply/nondegree)

but if you want my advice, you're not gunna be doing yourself any favors by jumping right back into school. i don't know you but if you're anything like me, you likely need some time and other experiences to mature first. going back prematurely will rekt u and u wont get the degree anyways."

scrubs21,"Check the community colleges website. If they have it at Parkland, you have to apply to Parkland (takes about 10 minutes) and after a couple of days they will admit you, then you sign up for the classes you want. 

If you don't want to be an accountant, I think taking it at a community college would be a good choce. Curtis and Shapland teach accy as if everyone is going into accounting, especially Shapland, and that makes it very difficult. (I don't know how the other person on here got 100% after the curve without going to class, since attendance is part of the curve. Shapland's average exam score is 60%, for reference)

Side note: I think I read once that if you have to take either ACCY 201 and 202 at a community college, or both at UIUC. You can't take one here and one somewhere else. But I've looked for that site since then and haven't found it, so maybe ask your advisor about that."

xcougar22,"Hello,

I am a graduate student in ABE. It depends on where you choose to go. Due to dropping oil prices, some corn industry is shrinking as they lose price competitveness. That includes crop sensor industries as well as biofuel. But other industries from ABE might work well if it is about nanotechnology and bioengineering industries. These two are very different to each other. 

Plus, in industry levels, I dont really think major really matters. As long as you have good understandings of techniques, theory, and laboratory experiences, companies will be more than welcome to offer positions. In graduate students, there are many other majors in undergraduates also, me personally from chemistry background. Some co-workers' majors include chemical engineering, technical system managments, and civil engineering, and actually even general engineering. Some from other universities, but others from UIUC. 

For departmental aids, I am not sure. It is better to ask your advisors. I can't really tell chem E, but ABE offers multiple of advices programs, and I believe since ABE is small department compared to huge Civil or Chem E, you can interact with professors and staff members more in personal ways as well as professional perspectives. Graduate students life are different to undergraduates, but yes, I believe if you want to know more about industry in general, you can talk to some professors in ABE. "

Either way, I don’t think they will make a big fuss as long as you take care of this right away after you get here. Best to ask your advisor whether this might keep you from registering for classes and explain your situation to them to see if they can help in some way. 

I don’t think incomplete immunization records will keep you from registering since first of all your med records/immunization status cannot to disclosed to others without your permission. You can register but they will just tell you you cannot attend classes till you’re immunized "
TyphlosionGirl,"Once again, those are for the students living on campus because it doesn't interrupt their classes.

Sorry, but you won't get much sympathy from me (or other on-campus students) because we've pretty much all gone despite having work or some other conflict (I had to skip work, and surprise surprise, I didn't get fired).

ka3503,"You won't get expelled for two infractions because based on what you said, they seem pretty minor. At most, you will have to attend an academic integrity counseling session and be put on conduct probation. With regards to your technical GPA, you should legit ask your advisor on the next steps. Maybe you can take a light semester and focus on boosting your technical GPA.

I hope you learned your lesson. NEVER cheat again in life. The internet can lure you into finding the answers, but the CS and ECE department are one step ahead with their auto graders. Most academic integrity violations happen in these two departments anyway. Next time you're struggling on a problem or have personal issues preventing progress, notify course staff immediately.

There have been other students in similar situations, and don't hesitate to reach out if you can. Feel free to shoot me a PM as well. Sometimes talking about the situation can help you recover from depression."

rich7561,"1) Ask your advisor at registration. They are your best friend.

2) As for your friend who has ""all 4 years"" planned out, it's probably thanks to something like this: (https://mcb.illinois.edu/undergrad/downloads/Typical_Four-Year_Plan_Feb2015.pdf) or this (https://mcb.illinois.edu/undergrad/downloads/Typical_Pre-Med_Four-Year_Plan_Feb2015.pdf). These are good things to think about now, but like /u/dogemaster00 said, things will definitely change.

3) Don't get hung up on AP, and don't get your hopes up. The most recent changes to the AP Policy university wide means you can use any AP credit 3 or above. Do NOT do this with everything. Your advisor will tell you the same, and MCB will do everything to stonewall you, with good reason. U.S. History and Lit are one thing, those can be great for getting GenEds out of the way. But do not dare try and use Calc, Chem, Bio, etc... You will fail the upper level courses that those might cover the pre-requisites for."

mrantry,"Well, we don't really offer a neuroscience program for undergrads. Neuroscience itself is an IPS (independent plan of study), that you need to petition for and get approved by a board.  I, at one time, was pursuing MCB and Psychology as a dual degree. If you want to do something like computational neuroscience, I really recommend getting your undergrad in something like CS + X (I'd probably choose psychology with a focus on cognitive psych or MCB), and then get a graduate degree in neuroscience. Are you considering medical school? 

I definitely recommend volunteering as well. If you don't have to have a part time job, Carle will let you volunteer in the neuroscience department (get your application in early, this department fills up quickly). In addition, look for labs doing research in computational neuroscience. Check out [the faculty] (http://neuroscience.illinois.edu/research/Computational%20Neuroscience) for the CNSP at UIUC and see if they're accepting any undergrads. 

All in all, ask your advisor. They will have the most up to date information on the program. UIUC is a fantastic place for neuroscience grads, and undergrads who would like to do a little research into the field. Our CS program speaks for itself. "
Ness817,These would be great questions to ask your advisor. I talked with mine recently and he stated that most students who are psychology and biology go down the MCB side of biology bc it deals with chemical processes more.
VictorGW,"Rule of thumb: ask your advisor. 
But I think you might wanna focus on boosting your GPA ASAP.
As a backup plan, look into ACES. Like other people have pointed out, ACES offer programs that mirrors CoB's accountancy &amp; finance programs.

If all of the above fails and you wanted to major in finance because you want to work in the industry, find something that you like &amp; excel at among the STEM majors. STEM majors are in high demand in the industry.

But I found out that the course doesnt transfer over to uiuc as PHYS 211. It transfers over as PHYS 101 instead. And I wanted to transfer into industrial engineering, so PHYS 101 did me no good. So the following semester, I enrolled into PHYS 235. In that class, I've encountered many students who were into engineering and the physical sciences, which PHYS 211 is at the core of. PHYS 101 is more for those going into pre-med or some science that requires no calculus. But you're going into CS, so it could be different for you....but Im not sure. It wouldnt hurt to ask your advisor if PHYSICS 235 is the course you actually need. "

mathuiuc,"A non-failing grade is a passing grade, with the following fine print:

1. If you're in a program that requires a certain minimum grade in major courses, such as Secondary Education, you need to hit that minimum.

2. The grade won't count in your UIUC GPAs, but it will count in your ""combined"" (UIUC+transfer) GPAs.

3. There are definitely overall minimum GPAs you need to graduate, although one low grade won't usually break this. Some programs also have required minimum technical GPAs--ask your advisor.

Finally, if you actually need to use Calc III in later classes, a C grade from a community college is not a good sign. Best wishes preparing for your final!!"

[deleted],"I think this is the best time to use “ask your advisor”. "
[deleted],"I agree and disagree. Some of the posters on /r/uiuc could have just as easily googled their question or e-mailed their advisor/professor. However, sometimes people just like to make conversation or get input from other people. When I'm out with a group of friends and I ask about a class or something, they don't say, ""Why are you asking us? Just ask your advisor. That's what they're there for. Quit wasting our time.""

Regardless, I don't see why people complain about the type of questions that get asked on /r/uiuc. If you don't like them, just ignore them. Don't comment on them. Downvote them (if you feel the need) and move on. A few people may want to take the time to answer. There's no need to bash the original poster.

It's not like /r/uiuc is a really high-quality subreddit anyway. Not sure why people are so particular about this."
[deleted],"Section X doesn't have a final.

Take it. 

Ask your advisor not reddit if it'll still count as the pre-req. I don't see why not though. "
[deleted],"Honestly, these really aren't the kinds of questions you should be asking right before finals week.

A class's final, in most cases, marks the end of the class. Your question is basically asking: Can I drop a class after I finish it? The answer, in most cases, is no. The actual answer is go ask your advisor. Dropping a class this late into the semester requires advisor approval at the very least. Whether they'll give that to you is not up to Reddit."
[deleted],"As much as I (really) hate this response because it's usually meant to be condescending or whatever...

ask your advisor. I'm sure just shooting an animal science advisor would get you the straight answer pretty quickly :)"
apschmitz,"I know it's a cliche here to say to ask your advisor, but you should talk to an advisor (or, better, the dean in charge of dual degrees) in both Engineering and in LAS. The dual degree requirements are somewhat extensive (you need a significant number of credits in one major that aren't used for your other degree), and they're somewhat hesitant to do a Math + CS dual degree given that the CS in LAS/Math degree exists.

That's not to say it's not possible: I did it, but you'll need a good reason. In my case, I did it because it was the only way to get a CS degree in engineering with a secondary education minor, but I did get some pushback until I explained everything to the relevant deans. It sounds like you've started planning things out, but I'd also recommend looking up the requirements both for the degrees you want and for the dual degree program, and plotting out which courses you intend to take which semesters, as that will help you argue that it's possible, and show what you'll be doing to make it worth giving you two separate degrees.

In terms of the other part of your question, though, I don't know how useful having the two degrees will be. Many places would be happy with CS+Stats, and not care about an extra Math degree, but if you can come up with a situation where it matters, maybe that'll be the reasoning you need, both to justify it to yourself and to justify it to the deans."
apschmitz,"James Scholar requirements vary based on the college, but are generally less difficult than CHP's requirements (and often a subset, so if you're a Chancellor's Scholar, you may meet the James Scholar requirements anyway).

JK in seriousness they have added a new program called pre-engineering which is supposedly a mandatory waiting-zone between any college and the college of engineering. Unless your advisor says theres an exception, you will have to leave biology, go into pre-engineering, pass pre-engineering, and then go into bioengineering. By ""passing pre-engineering"", I mean getting a 3.75 with competitive review and satisfying course transfer requirements. Unfortunately, upper classmen or anyone not a freshman do not have to do pre-engineering so they do not know about it as much as I do but it is basically pergatory, a weed out zone, and btw I should mention a 3.75 technical GPA is very very hard. Again, ask your advisor if pre-engineering is what you have to go through. If it is, its a trap."

The MS programs are a mix -- some departments provide TA/RA's, others don't. ECE lumps all the bachelors graduates who want to get a PhD into the MS degree along with people doing MS by research, and these are funded through TA/RA/Fellowship, for example. 

Getting a PhD is a commitment -- probably 5-7 years of your life working on one or few problems in depth. Masters is just more coursework and you might be out in a year or year and a half. It does help to think which you actually want to do. Ask your advisor or grad students or something."

AlmostGrad100,"&gt; If you look at any unique questions asked on this subreddit, the answers are generally very nice and of high quality.

Not necessarily. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/2el36q/how_do_office_hours_work/) is an example. I don't remember any other freshman asking about how office hours worked, but it was highly downvoted at the time I answered the question. 

All questions don't have equal relevance for everyone. A question that might seem to have an obvious answer to a senior might not seem like that to a freshman. Also, ""ask your advisor"" is the most frequent sarcastic response, but most people want to have some sense of the issue they are concerned about before they go and speak to someone with authority. There is no need to shame such people and tell them to man up, or to tell them that they aren't going to make it in this big bad world if they are such a scaredy-cat. Some might just be seeking reassurance or comfort. Many people are stressed and anxious at school, there is no need to bully them and put them down like that."
AlmostGrad100,"&gt;Maybe you could just, oh, I don't know, _not do that then_?  Nobody forces you to read or answer every post.

Yes, that is why I always protest when people respond to frequently asked questions with ""google it"", ""use the search bar"", ""ask your advisor"". Maybe the person who is posting about doing poorly in classes is looking for advice, comfort, and reassurance from anonymous strangers, which mere information from google or old reddit posts won't provide. Is it necessary to be mean to that person and give them such curt and sarcastic responses? How about not saying anything at all rather than giving such unhelpful replies?"
AlmostGrad100,"One reason could be that the targets of the massacre are of a different race from the [majority demographic of this sub](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oMcal685R58vodc78s-h2FHjhtdS_0Mj1rVnWBEdCJg/viewanalytics) and thus many people on this sub care little about OP's cause - if that's the case, it's rather sad.

cleverdragon1,Great question. Ask your advisor
cleverdragon1,"First know that you're not alone and a lot of people are in the same boat as you and that it's ok to mess up as long as you learn from your mistakes and kick ass next year. 

Also, there is only so much this subreddit can tell you so please ask your advisor. They can give much better advice than random people on Reddit. 

UIUC is a world class university and just making it in means you are smart and is a feat of it's own. It might take you an extra semester or year to graduate but it's important to not give up and learn from your mistakes. Best of luck!"
cleverdragon1,Yes. They go over what I need to know from 173 which is BSTs and a few other topics. Idk if you will get kicked out...ask your advisor or shoot them an email
cleverdragon1,"Hi there,

Don't be fooled...it's much harder than it looks. I was in your shoes a few years ago and I got knocked into reality when I decided to take ece 110,120 ,phys 211, and math 286 in the same semester. Every class but math had a lab associated with it and 120 made me stick with EE instead of CE. A 3.5 is definitely attainable with just a decent understanding of the material and strong work ethic (equal numbers of B+ and A-s) but a 3.8+ will require a incredible work ethic and a bit of luck as well. The only kids I know that have been able to keep up a 3.8+ are extremely dedicated to studying/working in the lab or library and are going into academia. In your case, you will have to do much better than I did because of increased competition so I would say to not overload on tech classes like I did. Instead, take 3tech classes a semester with a gen ed and a club to get involved in and you will be Gucci my friend. In addition, CE would be much more realistic to get into since we are not overloaded with people. But who am I to give you advice...your most valuable  resource would be to ASK YOUR ADViSOR. 

P.S. similar questions have been asked many times before so look on the subreddit  before posting next time. "
curiosityshop,"Of course, ask your advisor. My answer is probably. If my experience with the doctorate is any indicator, yes, you would need to continue to register for thesis credit until you finish and submit your thesis. The rationale for this would be that you need to be a registered student in order to do work toward a degree. Your faculty advisor's time needs to be covered for the term (and his/her department compensated). You also might continue to use campus services (such as the library, computer labs, etc.), while completing your thesis. "
curiosityshop,"Ask your advisor or college academic dean. They have lots of experience with this kind of trajectory for students and will also know what does or doesn't get put on an official transcript. 

Even though it can be difficult to face the consequences by talking to someone in a position of authority, make yourself do it. It's part of maturing and moving on. 

For this kind of important life query, don't ask the Internet."
jeffgerickson,"If you have an assistantship, you only need 8 hours to be considered full-time.

http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article3_part3_3-301.html

If you don't have an assistantship, ask your advisor for 1 hour of thesis or independent-study credit. If they say no, fire them."
jeffgerickson,Seriously.  Ask your advisor.
jeffgerickson,"Talk with Steve Herzog and/or Heather Zike in the CS Academic Office.  Nothing is guaranteed, but there may be things you can do to improve your chances.

tl;dr: Ask your advisor.  (But not your LAS advisor.)"
jeffgerickson,"Only under serious extenuating circumstances that are out of your control, like a serious illness or injury. The student code explicitly forbids dropping a class late just because you are failing.

Ask your advisor on Monday about grade replacement."

snakesarecool,"I'd say that would be the wrong way to look at it.

If you are looking at a very prescribed series of courses at UIUC, trying to replace some at parkland may not prepare you for later ones.  For example, intro to computer science may not cover all the things the second CS class at UIUC might expect.  However, if you just need to take a one-off, you'll be fine.  You can also ask your advisor for their experiences.

I wouldn't say that the classes there were easier, but again, just depending on which class you're in."
snakesarecool,"Usually not. Really depends on how your department does stuff. Some people will start the project in the fall and then register for it in the spring. Ask your advisor for how to handle the situation, and check that the faculty human of record is cool with an extended plan. "
snakesarecool,"You can ask your advisor, who might be able to make some recommendations.

You can also look here:  https://courses.illinois.edu/search/form You can search for 400/500 level courses and in the Part of Term section select Part of Term B.  Still read the descriptions carefully about start/end dates."

Baren_the_Baron,"The more pertinent question is what you want to do. You say econ or marketing, does that mean financial analysis? There are CS applications there. However, just going into finance doesn't mean you suddenly won't be coding. Econ doesn't correlate to no code. It's moreso your career path that determines how much code you will be writing. 

It seems your main grievance is that you don't want to be coding long term. If that's the case then there are plenty of people who can relate with that sentiment. I recall there being a speaker on campus this past year who was somewhat similar. He didn't like coding much so he tried to move into a management position and got an MBA after working for a few years. 

Keeping that in mind, if you're interested in where CS can take you, I'd encourage you to go to more of the tech talks at Siebel, since you'll end up with a lot more valuable examples with what your career path might look like. Alternatively you can ask your advisor. 


Side note
&gt; another cog in their world

This sounds pretentious."
Baren_the_Baron,"Exam practices vary. Sometimes it's in class, but for most classes I've taken they haven't been. Usually there's a specified time and date and you will go to a specific location, rather than go to your class and take it there. 

Recitation is just another word for discussion section. Most larger classes are a pair of lecture and discussion. The lecture section is the section in which your professor lectures to masses of people, whereas the recitation or discussion section can be considered work time. These are smaller sections which tend to have at most 30 people and you do class work with others. 

Whether or not discussion is more important than lecture is on you and the class. Some classes enforce going to lecture and/or discussion with differing impacts on your grade. It's impossible to make a general statement. 

I don't know anything about the honors course since most of them vary heavily and change with instructors. You're better creating a thread asking about it specifically. Some one credit hours are jokes, others are more difficult than regular classes.

Advisors are good for help planning general things related to classes or asking about the curriculum as a whole, but they aren't a substitute for properly researching about classes and asking peers. Expecting your advisor to be able to answer every specific question you have isn't realistic. It's almost impossible to know every class dynamic, especially as instructors and course material changes. 

If your schedule is unbalanced, then change it around. If you can't because classes are filled up, then that sucks, but it's reality for CS majors here. Classes get filled up quick. Take what you can when you can and try to make the best of it. If your classes overlap and are at the exact same time since the other slots, ask your advisor what you need to do then. They might be able to get you an override. If your classes are just all on the same day, then just gotta suck it up.

If you're annoyed, then that's normal. Scheduling is usually a bitch. 

Also definitely don't name drop the advisor you dislike.

ProgramTheWorld,"Connecting with people in the department is important, but the most important is to show them you are *passionate* about the department that you are trying to transfer into. Take classes and be involved in activities that will reflect that. Don't worry about saving money in DGS - it won't save you much.

I would say the most important things you should are the requirements of transferring into the colleges that you want. Stop asking for suggestions on Reddit - ask your advisors. Transferring into the College of Engineering is hard, and that's a fact, but it's not impossible."

astralhachiretsu,"General Advice: Check the website/Ask your advisor.

Actual Advice: You still need to take ALEKS (Math), regardless of IB/AP credit, but it's basically all pre-calc. If you do poorly, your advisor will try to put you in the remedial math class or have you retake the exam. 

If you have completed your foreign language requirement or do not plan to take language courses here in the same language, you don't need to take the placement test.

You do not need to take the tests for Chemistry, Physics, CS, and other courses that you have AP Credit in. (If you're a Bio major, your advisor will try to convince you to take the class anyway, if you're a Chem/CS major, the credits you get are different than the classes you need for the degree, so it's basically useless. Still fulfills geneds either way)."
astralhachiretsu,"Obligatory ask your advisor.

For courses through community college and the like, check https://transferology.com/ to see what courses transfer for 441 or 212 at your local community college.

Specifically for grade replacement, I'm not sure if community college course grades can be used to replace UofI grades, even when credits transfer- check with your advisor about that."
